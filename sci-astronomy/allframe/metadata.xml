  ALLFRAME is a suite of crowded stellar photometry software: DAOPHOT
  and its subsequent ALLSTAR, DAOGROW, DAOMATCH, DAOMASTER and ALLFRAME.
  Before using these programs, or if you are not familiar with these
  programs, you are strongly advised to read the following papers:

  * DAOPHOT - A computer program for crowded-field stellar photometry

  * On the growth-curve method for calibrating stellar photometry with CCDs
  http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990PASP..102..932S

  * The center of the core-cusp globular cluster M15: CFHT and HST
